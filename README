# Struggle for Balance time convertor
Hello this is my little project for my universe which allows to convert time and dates from Earth Standard Time to Universal Standard Time which is the common time unit in my fictional universe.

## Background
The times share one second as the common unit, above that the UST follows this formula:

1 second

Standard minute = 100 seconds

Standard hour = 100 Standard minutes

Standard day = 10 Standard hours

Standard year = 500 Standard days

### UST
UST was established on new years eve of Earth Year 2400 to celebrate a new era in the human development and in the galactic community as well. Also the joining of Earth Confederacy gave enough votes to push the proposal through. It were the Grimnaar and Iyat'ktal who were pro and the Tro'ael and Axxonians who were against it, or to be more precise the Axxonians were indifferent. The Grimnaar and Iyat'ktal wanted order in times as previously it meant that every outpost had its own time and that made time synchronization very difficult. When humans joined in they joined the Grimnaar and Iyat'ktal as they already had similar experiences with their own outposts and colonies. The Tro'ael saw independent times as expressions of identity and the Axxoni were still on old Alliance time from thousands of years ago.

### EST
To make things complicated starting in 2400 there was a calendar reform that made February 29th not a transition year anomaly, but a standard day to be part of the calendar every year. This was to account for the changes in Earths orbit due to events previous events.

### IST
Imperial Standard Time is a time unit that was used by the Grimnaar and begins dating from the establishment of the united empire. Often times Grimnaar still refer to event in "before empire" and "during empire".

## Future plans
The plans are to improve the convertor with few more features described in the issues and hopefully later add more times like the mentioned IST.
